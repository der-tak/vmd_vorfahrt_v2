	"engDescr":"This motorcycle made after 1962 by the state-owned enterprise VEB Motorradwerk Zschopau features a characteristic rectangular front section comprising the headlamp and petrol tank. It had full swing arm suspension on both the front and rear wheels. MZ engines were also installed in motor scooters made by VEB Industriewerke Ludwigsfelde (Pitty, Wiesel, Berlin and Troll) in a slightly modified form. The motorcycle’s sister model with a 250 cc engine was available in a similar design after 1967."
