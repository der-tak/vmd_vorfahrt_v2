	"engDescr":"The Wartburg 1.3 was manufactured from 1988 onwards and replaced the Wartburg 353. It was the first passenger car in East Germany to be mass-produced with a VW four-stroke engine. This was also installed shortly afterwards in the Barkas B 1000-1 from 1989 and the Trabant 1.1 from 1990. From the time the decision was made in 1984 to produce VW engines in East Germany, another four years passed before they went into full-scale production. Hurdles included the specification that no modifications should be made to the vehicles in which the VW engines were installed, which turned out to be unviable: Extensive conversions were required to adapt the cars to the engine. Despite their modern four-stroke engines, the vehicles were still well behind international standards in technical terms."
