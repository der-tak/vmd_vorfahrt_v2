	"engDescr": "The Wartburg 311 was manufactured by the state-owned VEB Automobilwerk Eisenach as a saloon car starting in 1956. A coupé version followed in 1957, and continued to be built until 1965, initially at VEB Karosseriewerke Meerane and, after 1959, at VEB Karosseriewerke Dresden. The Wartburg 311 coupé, like the convertible, was a rare sight on East German streets. On the one hand, at 16,200 East German marks, the passenger car was prohibitively expensive for most citizens, whose average annual gross income in 1960 was 6,600 East German marks. On the other, many of the 5,500 vehicles produced were exported.<br>This coupé had three owners in total, and underwent various technical and visual alterations. It was not taken out of service until 1991."
