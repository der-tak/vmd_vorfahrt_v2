	"engDescr":"The Skoda Octavia made by Czech automobile manufacturer Skoda from 1959 to 1964 was imported to East Germany from the early 1960s. It was bought by people who could afford it – at 14,500 East German marks for a new vehicle, it was almost as expensive as the lowest-priced version of the Wartburg 311 (saloon car) – or preferred a car with a four-stroke engine. The successor models with a rear engine – the Skoda 1000 series in the mid-1960s and the 100 series in the 1970/1980s – were also imported to East Germany. Compared to the robust Octavia, however, these were highly susceptible to rust and repairs. At the end of the 1980s, some Skoda Favorit cars with a front-mounted engine were once again imported to East Germany. "
