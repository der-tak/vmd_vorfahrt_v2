	"engDescr": "The P 70 was the first automobile to be mass-produced in Germany with a wooden-frame body covered with panels made of thermosetting plastic (Duroplast). It was the forerunner of the Trabant P 601. The compact car was made from 1955 to 1959 by the state-owned VEB Automobilwerk Zwickau (renamed VEB Sachsenring Automobilwerke Zwickau as of 1958). It was available as a saloon car, coupé or extremely roomy estate car. The bodywork was supplied by the state-owned VEB Karosseriewerke Dresden.<br>The P 70 was an intermediate model, produced prior to the originally planned Trabant P 50 compact car, which did not go into production until 1957. However, with a basic price of 9,250 East German marks, the P 70 was unaffordable for most citizens. The average gross annual income in 1956 was 5,500 East German marks."
