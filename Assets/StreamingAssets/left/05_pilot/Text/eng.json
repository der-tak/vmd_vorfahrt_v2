	"engDescr":"Automobiles have been manufactured by companies in and around Dresden for over 100 years. One example was Pilotwagen AG in Bannewitz, which started production in the 1920s. It produced only a few hundred vehicles before shutting down operations in 1928.<br>Most Pilot vehicles were equipped with a body made by Sächsische Waggonfabrik Werdau, although the one on this Pilot 6/30 PS is by the Dresden-based company Gläser.<br>The driver of the Pilot still sat on the right-hand side of the car, similar to a coachman. Due to increasing traffic and to give the driver a better view of oncoming traffic, especially when overtaking, the steering wheel was moved to the left. The first German automobile with left-hand steering on a standard production vehicle was a 1921 Audi Type K. All other automobile manufacturers followed suit in the course of the 1920s."
