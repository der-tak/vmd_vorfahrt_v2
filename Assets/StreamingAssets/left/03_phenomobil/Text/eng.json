	"engDescr":"Similar to motorcycle manufacturers, various automotive companies attempted to produce affordable cars. One example is the three-wheeled Phänomobil. Its unique feature is that its design in 1904 was not based on a horse-drawn carriage, as most automobiles were, but rather on a motorcycle.<br>Phänomen Werke Gustav Hiller AG in Zittau originally produced bicycles and motorcycles. It was therefore able to incorporate numerous motorcycle parts in the new vehicle, which cut manufacturing costs and thus the vehicle’s sale price.<br>Three-wheeled vehicles were particularly popular in Germany between the wars, because they were more affordable than most other automobiles.<br>The driver steered the vehicle with a tiller-style mechanism."
