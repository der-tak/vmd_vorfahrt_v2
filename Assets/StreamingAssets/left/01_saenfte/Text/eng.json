	"engDescr": "Sedans were expensive to hire and could only be afforded by wealthy citizens. \nAlthough they were not a particularly fast means of transport, they allowed passengers to reach their destination without getting their shoes or clothes dirty from the dusty roads.\nThis sedan has glass windows and an upholstered seat. The roof could be raised and opened to accommodate female passengers with particularly extravagant hairstyles.\nIt was carried by two men using poles and shoulder belts.\nCouncillor Johann Friedrich Landsberger introduced the first public sedans to Dresden in 1705. In the same year, Dresden city council published an order including a transport fee. 'Hofchaisenträger' were sedan bearers who offered their services exclusively to members of the Saxon court. \nThis form of transport was phased out in Dresden in 1878, when the litters were no longer able to compete with horse-drawn carriages and the expansion of the tram network."
