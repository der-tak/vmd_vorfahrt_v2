  "engDescr": "Penny-farthings first became popular in England in 1872. The elegant high-wheelers were the first bicycles made of steel. Comprising around 580 individual parts, they were extremely complex technical vehicles. As the pedals were attached to the front wheel, its diameter alone determined the bicycleâ€™s speed of up to 30 km/h. Getting on and off the bicycle as well as riding it and braking required practice and was suited to more athletic cyclists. As they were so difficult and dangerous to handle, causing countless head injuries, penny-farthings were replaced by the safety bicycle after around 15 years The Seidel & Naumann sewing machine factory and iron foundry in Dresden started making high-wheel bicycles based on the English model."
