	"engDescr":"The Hanomag 2/10 PS made by Hannoversche Maschinenbau AG was the first German compact car mass-produced on an assembly line starting in 1925. The car’s manufacturing method and workmanship, its simple technology and low weight made it largely affordable. Because the shape of its chassis was reminiscent of a loaf of bread, the Hanomag was nicknamed “Kommissbrot”. According to a contemporary German saying, “One pound of sheet steel, a jar of paint and there you have a Hanomag”! In the late 1920s, a worker typically had to save for 10 months to afford a basic Hanomag model costing about 1,975 reichsmarks.<br><br>This Hanomag was made especially for the ADAC automobile club, which was introduced in Germany in 1927."
