	"engDescr":"Phänomen Werke Gustav Hiller AG based in Zittau advertised its 4 RL as “The maintenance-free delivery van”, because the vehicle was extremely robust and very simply equipped. A novel feature in commercial vehicle engineering was the air-cooled engine. Prompted by a request from the German Imperial Postal Service, which was the main buyer of the company’s three-wheeled Phänomobil, the 4 RL was developed as its successor, primarily on account of the outdated technology and instability of the Phänomobil. Orders from the German Imperial Postal Service secured the existence of the company through difficult economic times.<br><br>This exhibit was originally used by the German Imperial Postal Service as a delivery van, and converted into a pickup after 1945."
