	"descr":"The MZ RT 125/3 was the last official model of the MZ RT 125 series of motorcycles produced by the state-owned VEB Motorradwerk Zschopau starting in 1950. It was based on the pre-war model DKW RT 125 from 1939. Some 310,000 vehicles rolled off the line at the factory until 1962. The engine in the MZ-RT 125/1 was also installed in a slightly modified form in the Pitty and Wiesel mopeds made at VEB Industriewerke Ludwigsfelde. In addition to its low running costs, riders above all appreciated the motorcycle’s manoeuvrability and road handling. Some 5,000 of its successor, the RT 125/4, were built between 1963 and 1965. However, this model was unfamiliar and unattainable for East Germans, as it was produced exclusively for export."
